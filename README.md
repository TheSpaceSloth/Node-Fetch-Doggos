# Node-Fetch-Doggos

### It's a Node JS script that uses the Fetch API to get photos of random dogs from the Dog CEO API and then saves them directly to your computer.

### Currently, the script writes the image files to your computer with a randomly generated string for a name.  Future editions will use the source filename.

### This script runs the fetch API ten times then stops.  I included setTimeout to slow the number of requests to avoid burderning the API.
